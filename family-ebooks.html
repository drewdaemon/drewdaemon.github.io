	<h1>Family ebooks</h1>
	<p>This is a set of family histories that have been converted to ebooks.</p>

	<h2>How to read the ebooks</h2>
	<p>These books are distributed as EPUB files. EPUB is a file format for ebooks. </p>
	<p>E-readers such as Kindle support EPUB. To get a book on your Kindle, visit the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle">send-to-Kindle page</a>.</p>
	<p>To read an EPUB (or any ebook for that matter) on your phone or desktop computer, you need a computer program installed.</p>
	<p>You can download the EPUB and try to open it to see if you already have a reader installed. Macs, for example, come with an application called "Books" that understands EPUB files.</p>
	<p>If you find you need to install a reader, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16571048011">Amazon's Kindle Reader software</a> is very good and can be installed on Android, iPhone, Mac, and Windows. It also syncs your library between all your devices.</p>
	<p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/download">Calibre</a> is another good choice for desktop computers. It isn't as pretty, but still does a good job and has no ads.</p>
