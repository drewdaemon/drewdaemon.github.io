Growing up, I was an everything guy. I tried a million different hobbies and earned a million merit badges as a boy scout. My parents supported my curiousity generously. For that stage of life, I think this was a fantastic way to spend my time. I went broad and ended up learning a ton and finding several fields I was interested in as a career, as well as several life-enriching interests no one will ever pay me for.

(By the way, Dave Epstein validates my growing up in _Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World_. At least I think he does, based on the first few chapters which I read. It's one of those books where I got the idea pretty quickly and just kind of stopped. Still, I recommend at least the first chapters.)

However, since my growing up years, I've tried to focus a bit more. I want to get really, really good at a few things. I've always admired people like my brother-in-law. That guy can sit down and progress toward a skill with an unbelievable drive.

"Okay," you say, "the solution is simple, Drew. Set some specific, measurable goals for this year, start saying 'no' to things that aren't going to get you closer to your goals, and hit those goals hard."

Well, unfortunately, as you're saying these things my heart rate is rising. At some level I am terrified that I will be _confined_ in a goal-prison of my own making. What if I change my mind... what if I lose interest in my particular goals... what if they are the wrong goals... what if I get sick?

You: "Well, you can always change your goals, Drew... you're still in control."

Me: "But then I'll feel like a miserable failure... I wasn't able to stick with it. I'm not a finisher. I can never focus on anything."

## Are habits the answer?

In _Atomic Habits_, James Clear argues for habits over goals. There are several advantages to focusing on building a habit over achieving a goal. One of the main pros is that the habit lasts indefinitely while the goal ends when it is achieved. Another is that habits become more effortless over time, freeing up cognitive space and willpower toward other things.

I recommend the book and I think habits are powerful, but I don't think they solve my problem, at least not automatically.

Unlike goals, habits don't feel confining to me in quite the same way. However, they also tend to be rather specific.

At the end of the day, I'm not out to demonize habits or goals. I use both quite extensively. But, I think what I have often missed is a broader framework to guide me toward the _right_ goals and habits, and reassure me when the way I spend my time needs to change (or I want it to).

## Introducing themes

In 2023


In 2024 I tried an experiment.
